## 🔥 Key Features  
🔹 **No Single Point of Failure** – Distributed monitoring across independent validators.  

🔹 **Trustless Transparency** – Website owners can prove uptime without a central entity.  

🔹 **Crypto Incentives** – Validators earn rewards for monitoring and reporting website health.  

🔹 **Decentralized Monitoring** – Multiple nodes check website status instead of a single company.  

🔹 **Real-Time Alerts** – Instant notifications for downtime or performance issues.  

🔹 **Security & Privacy** – No third-party access to website data.

## 🛑 Problem Statement  
Traditional website monitoring systems are **centralized, opaque, and vulnerable** to **downtime, censorship, and manipulation**. They rely on single providers, limiting transparency and control.  

---

## ✅ Solution  

Our **dPIN-based monitoring system** decentralizes website uptime tracking by leveraging independent validators across a global network. Unlike traditional systems, which rely on a single authority, our solution ensures **real-time, trustless, and tamper-proof monitoring** without any central points of failure. Website owners can **prove uptime transparently**, while users receive **instant alerts** for downtime or performance issues. Validators are incentivized with **crypto rewards**, fostering a **self-sustaining, censorship-resistant** ecosystem that enhances reliability, security, and trust in website monitoring.

✨ **Website owners** can verify uptime transparently.  

⚡ **Users** receive **instant alerts** for downtime or performance issues.  

💰 **Validators** are rewarded with **crypto incentives**, fostering a **self-sustaining, censorship-resistant** monitoring ecosystem.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup  
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lviffy/dPIN.git
cd dPIN

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your specific configuration

# Run the backend server
node index.js

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Set up frontend environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Clerk publishable key and other configs

# Run the frontend development server
npm run dev

# Open your browser at http://localhost:5173
```

## 🔑 Getting API Keys

Before you can run the application, you'll need to obtain several API keys and credentials:

### 1. JWT Secret
- This is used for authentication in the backend
- Generate a secure random string:
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
  Or simply create a strong password-like string

### 2. Solana Wallet Keys (Admin)
- Generate a Solana keypair for the admin account:
  ```bash
  # Install Solana CLI tools if you haven't already
  solana-keygen new
  ```
  - The output will show your public key and save your private key
  - Use these values for `ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY` and `ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY`

### 3. Solana RPC URL
- Sign up for a free account at [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- Create a new Solana app (can use Devnet for testing)
- Copy the HTTP URL from your dashboard
- Format: `https://solana-devnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY`

### 4. Clerk Authentication
- Create an account at [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/)
- Set up a new application
- From your Clerk dashboard:
  - Get your `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (starts with `pk_test_`)
  - Get your `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` (starts with `sk_test_`)
  - Use the publishable key for both backend and frontend

### 5. Email Service (Nodemailer)
- If using Gmail:
  1. Go to your Google Account → Security
  2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
  3. Go to App passwords
  4. Create a new app password
  5. Use this password for `PASS_NODEMAILER`

After obtaining all keys, add them to your `.env` files in both backend and frontend directories.
